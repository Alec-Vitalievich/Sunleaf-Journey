# Sunflower Journey : The Quest For The Sun

 ## _A OOP Platformer Game Project_
 
Sunleaf Journey is a 2D platformer game developed in C++ using SFML v.2.6.1 using a variety of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. The game is centered around a plant that traverses through diverse landscapes like caves, gardens and forests in the search of a sunnier spot to set down roots.

Sunleaf Journey is designed to appeal to a wide audience, from children and adolescents to adults. The atmosphere is relaxing, featuring a 2D graphical interface that allows for the display of simple movement mechanics like running and jumping, obstacles such as spikes and lava, and collectables like little bits of sun. The gameâ€™s goal is to provide the player with a short but entertaining distraction from the chaotic nature of life around us.

## Installation

Sunflower Journey is made using SFML v.2.6.1 and thus the right version of SFML will need to be installed for your device. Information about SFML 2.6 can be found [here](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.6/).

# üåª Sunleaf Journey : The Quest For The Sun

 ## _A OOP Platformer Game Project in C++_
 
Sunleaf Journey is a 2D platformer game developed in C++ using SFML v.2.6.1 using a variety of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. The game is centered around a plant that traverses through diverse landscapes like caves, gardens and forests in the search of a sunnier spot to set down roots.

Sunleaf Journey is designed to appeal to a wide audience, from children and adolescents to adults. The atmosphere is relaxing, featuring a 2D graphical interface that allows for the display of simple movement mechanics like running and jumping, obstacles such as spikes and lava, and collectables like little bits of sun. The game‚Äôs goal is to provide the player with a short but entertaining distraction from the chaotic nature of life around us.
